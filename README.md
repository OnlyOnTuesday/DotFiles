# DotFiles

A collection of configuration files and scripts for Michael Cooney.

With the exception of xmonad.hs, files not in a subdirectory belong in the user's directory.

## File Structure
* **Top level**: files that belong in the home folder (excepting xmonad.hs)
* **elpa: packages** installed for emacs that I wanted transferred over from my old os
* **user-download**: packages downloaded for emacs (not using the emacs package manager) that I wanted transferred over from my old os
* **Bash**: Bash scripts that do various things to customize my computer

   Some scripts in the Bash folder are unfinished at the moment.
